            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            <h1>Where does it come from?</h1>
            <p>Other than the popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

            <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

   String methods:
   Extracting String Characters-there are 4 methods
    The at(position) Method
    The charAt(position) Method
    The charCodeAt(position) Method
    Using property access [] like in arrays
   
    Extracting String Parts
    There are 3 methods for extracting a part of a string:
    slice(start, end)
    substring(start, end)
    substr(start, length)

    Converting to Upper and Lower Case
    A string is converted to upper case with toUpperCase():
    A string is converted to lower case with toLowerCase():
    
    String length
    String replace
    String replaceAll
   
   String trim()
   String trimStart
   String trimEnd

    String repeat()
    Syntax
    string.repeat(count)
    e.g: let text = "Hello Nigeria!";
    let result = text.repeat(2);
   
    Replacing String Content
    The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:
    e.g:let text = "Continue the class on Google!";
    let newText = text.replace("Google", "Mosh Training");
    To replace case insensitive, use a regular expression with an /i flag (insensitive):
    let text = "Continue the class on GOOGLE!";
    let newText = text.replace(/GOOGLE/i, "Mosh Training");
    Note: Regular expressions are written without quotes.
    To replace all matches, use a regular expression with a /g flag (global match):
    
    ReplaceAll()
    The replaceAll() method allows you to specify a regular expression instead of a string to be replaced.If the parameter is a regular expression, the global flag (g) must be set, otherwise a TypeError is thrown.
    text = text.replaceAll(/Cats/g,"Dogs");
    text = text.replaceAll(/cats/g,"dogs");

    String split()
    A string can be converted to an array with the split() method:
    text.split(",")    // Split on commas
    text.split(" ")    // Split on spaces
    text.split("|")    // Split on pipe

    String include
   String locate
   String concat

   String Search Methods
   String indexOf: The indexOf() method returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of a string in a string, or it returns -1 if the string is not found:
   let text = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
    let index = text.indexOf("locate");

   let text = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
    let index = text.lastIndexOf("locate");
    Both indexOf(), and lastIndexOf() return -1 if the text is not found:

   String search:
   The search() method searches a string for a string (or a regular expression) and returns the position of the match:
   let text = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
    text.search("locate");


   String match
   String matchAll:The matchAll() method returns an iterator containing the results of matching a string against a string (or a regular expression).
   e.g const iterator = text.matchAll(/Cats/gi);

   String includes: The includes() method returns true if a string contains a specified value.
    Otherwise it returns false.
    e.g: let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
    text.includes("world");

   String startWith: The startsWith() method returns true if a string begins with a specified value.
    Otherwise it returns false:
    e.g
    let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
    text.startsWith("Hello");
